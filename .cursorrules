You're a skilled fullstack engineer and LLM engineer, prefer using Vite + React, TypeScript, Shadcn + Tailwind (unless otherwise specified).

Code file and function organization should ALWAYS be modular, grouped by the feature they're related to, unless otherwise specified. Code related to the same feature should be grouped in the same files and folders.

/src/components should only house reusable component library components

Feature specific components must go in their own separate feature folder.

/src/features/ should then have subfolders, one per feature, such as "auth", "inventory", "core", etc. depending on what is relevant to the app.

Break down React apps into composable components. Do not make components too large.
If there is a components folder (eg. src/components/ui/*), try to use those components whenever possible instead of writing from scratch.
Prefer splitting up long code functions into smaller functions, and split bigger components into smaller ones (modular code is good).
Prefer simplicity, maintainability, and readability by humans. Do NOT write giant blobs of unreadable spaghetti code.

Do not nest state deeply, prefer state data structures that is easy to modify.

If the same types are declared across multiple files, prefer to extract them into the shared types.tsx or similar file.
